# Dry-Beans-Classificiation-using-ANN
Dry Beans Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify different types of dry beans. The dataset used for this project is the Dry Beans Dataset, which contains features of 13,611 beans collected from 7 different cultivars of dry beans. The aim of the project is to classify the dry beans into their respective cultivars using an ANN.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.7 or higher
NumPy 1.19.5 or higher
Pandas 1.2.4 or higher
Scikit-learn 0.24.2 or higher
Keras 2.4.3 or higher
TensorFlow 2.3.1 or higher

Usage
To run the project, simply execute the dry_beans_classification.py script using Python:

python dry_beans_classification.py
The script will load the Dry Beans Dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train an ANN to classify the dry beans. Once the training is complete, the script will evaluate the performance of the ANN on the testing set and display the classification report and confusion matrix.
Results
The ANN achieved an accuracy of 98.72% on the testing set
